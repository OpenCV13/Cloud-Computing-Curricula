# Provider: Qwiklabs

Qwiklabs provides closed labs and temporary credentials to Google Cloud Platform, so students you can learn the cloud using the real thing. Includes a wide variety of training from introductory level to expert, instructor-led or self-paced, with topics like machine learning, security, infrastructure, app dev, and more.  Labs are combined into Quests, groups of related labs.

Many quests come with an extra challenge lab (that gives desired results but not step by step instructions) that will lead to [skill badges](https://cloud.google.com/training/badges) that can be shared on social media.
