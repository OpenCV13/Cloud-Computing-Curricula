**Azure IoT Curriculum**

This repo contains hands-on-labs and other lab and workshop based material designed to support the creation of IoT curricula for higher education, covering IoT and AI on the edge. All the labs use physical devices, such as Raspberry Pis and NVIDIA Jetson boards, and are designed for in-class or at home study. As an educator, you would use these labs in a blended learning environment, teaching concepts and theory in the classroom, mixed with labs from here to supplement the course and provide hands-on experience.

Most of the content here is Microsoft content available in other places - this repo brings some of the content together and provides a single place to find content across different gitHub repos, documentation, Microsoft Learn and other sites.

All the content contained in this repo is free for you to use in your courses however you see fit. We will endeavour to keep the content up to date, but seeing as technology moves fast, things may be missed. If you find any errors in these materials, please either [raise an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/iot-curriculum/issues), or feel free to [raise a PR with the fix](https://github.com/microsoft/iot-curriculum/pulls).

We will be continually adding and updating the content here. If there is a particular lab or content you would like added, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/iot-curriculum/issues). If you have content you would like to share, please [raise a PR](https://github.com/microsoft/iot-curriculum/pulls).

## Hardware needs

These labs make use of a variety of hardware, all connected to cloud services. Each lab indicates up front what hardware is required. There is also an overall list for an 'IoT Cart' that provides a complete, all-in-one hardware solution that covers all these labs. This is designed to be a 'course in a box' - you purchase everything on the list and that can be shared between groups of students learning IoT in a more IoT focused degree program, rather than a single course as part of a wider technology-based learning program. Details of the cart are in the [cart](./cart) folder.

## Device setup

The [devices](https://github.com/microsoft/iot-curriculum/tree/main/devices) folder contains details on setting up the different devices recommended for the IoT Cart.

## Labs

The [labs](https://github.com/microsoft/iot-curriculum/tree/main/labs) folder contains details on a range of different labs covering IoT and AI on the edge.

## Educator guides

The [educator-guides](https://github.com/microsoft/iot-curriculum/tree/main/educator-guides) folder contains guides for educators, including suggested course outlines and IoT lab guides.

## Microsoft Learn

[Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/Learn?WT.mc_id=academic-7372-jabenn) is a free, online training platform that provides interactive learning for Microsoft products and more. Our goal is to help you become proficient on our technologies and learn more skills with fun, guided, hands-on, interactive content that's specific to your role and goals.

There are a number of Learning Paths covering IoT technologies, services and solutions.
