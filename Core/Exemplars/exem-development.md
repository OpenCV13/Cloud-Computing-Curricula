# Exemplar for Cloud Platform Development

## Level: 
Undergraduate (Advanced)

## Credit Points: 
10 CATS Points (100 Hours)

## Subject Area: 
Cloud Computing

## Summary of Content: 
The module provides in-depth coverage of cloud computing technology exploring cloud architecture, 
platform and data virtualisation (relational and non-relational), scalability, delivery and 
deployment models and issues concerning cloud security. Students will be introduced to 
Platform as a Service (PaaS) software development.
